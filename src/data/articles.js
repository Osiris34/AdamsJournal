As a 22-year-old, I have so much more music to listen to. Even though I have had such a limited time on earth, I have listened to enough music to be able to constitute what a classic album is.

The five categories that make an album a classic are: Longevity, Cultural Impact, Musical Impact, Quality, and Subject Matter.

Longevity

Time is a great indicator that has shown whether an album was made for that intended purpose. Time can age an album like fine wine, or it can continuously show why the album is as bad as it was when it was released.

An album that time has favored(even though it doesn't need it) is a good kid. m.A.A.d city. When it was first released in October of 2012, Kendrick was already on a tear with the “underground” success of Section.80 and the singles off of good kid m.A.A.d city.

When you speak of longevity, this is one of the first albums that should be mentioned. “good kid m.A.A.d city” has been on the charts for 626 weeks, which equates to 12 years and 2 days. This is the first album to be on the charts for 10 years.

There is so much that I can say about this album, but it has stood the test of time, and with every listen, it gets better and better.

Another example is ‘Thriller” by Michael Jackson. A short album but filled with timeless tracks. Another thing the album has to have is songs that can last from the time of its release to the present day.

Thriller is the album that you introduce to kids. Kids love Thriller, so once you get them on board, they can make memories from these songs and rinse and repeat with their kids.

Cultural Impact

Culture is extremely important, and whether you identify with the culture or not, music has impacted it significantly. When the culture is impacted by an album, language and the way of thinking changes.

When it comes to language, there are a couple of albums that have done that. This album is not necessarily considered a classic, but Gunna’s 2017 project ‘Drip or Drown’ essentially introduced the world to the word ‘drip. ’ The impact was huge as the whole world was saying ‘drip.’

When it comes to the way of thinking, the album that comes to mind is “What’s Goin’ On.’ An album like this was able to change the perspective of the “ghetto”. Even though it highlights the many downtrodden feelings of being in the ghetto, this has the potential to shift the way of thinking.

If an album can shift the culture it can be considered a classic album.

Musical Impact

An album with a high musical impact can be a bit tricky. I only say this if an album can impact the way that people make music both lyrically and sonically.

If an album can alter the way the whole musical landscape produces music then it can be considered a classic album. For example, Q-Tip famed A Tribe called Quest producer influenced a large amount of producers in the music industry like Kanye West, Madlib, Pharrell, Tyler[the, Creator], and even J Dilla, who he mentored.

The lo-fi jazz boombap production of Q-Tip would give us albums like “The Low-End Theory” or “Midnight Maruaders”,albums that shifted how producers produce. These albums would bring the masses albums like “College Dropout”, “Donuts”, and even “In My Mind.”

Albums like sometimes don’t fall into the longevity category simply because for its time it was great and helped influence the people who influence the next generation.

Lyrically ,Biggie’s “Ready to Die” is the first album that comes up when I think an album that impacted how artists would rap. People like Jay Z who would lines form Biggie songs into his and the countless other people who have used his lyrics.

That shows that what he was saying and how he was saying it was a paradigm shift in the musical landscape.

Even though many artists like to stick wth one genre and not expand on it, then there are some that artist wh put out albums that bend the genre that their end by adding aspects from different genres.

One album that perfectly represents that statement is “Songs in the Key of Life.” 1976 brought out a large amount of great albums but this album gave us the best of Stevie and that can’t be topped.

This album brings in Soul, R&B, Gospel, and Latin which builds and ends Stevie’s classic period.

Quality

A concern that many people have nowadays is the quality of an album. Many listeners believe that there is quality has left the music industry specifically Hip-Hop.

Quality is probably the one trait that can make up for all the other traits. If an album has quality but not the other 3 or 4 there is a chance that it can be considered a classic. Usually, a quality album has great subject matter and can stand the test of time.

Sometimes the subject matter may be generic so in turn the production makes up for it.

What I consider a quality album is great production, great singing/rapping and 9 to 14 songs. The max is 15 songs.

Quality albums don’t come often so when you hear one you have to savor it for as long as you can. A good example of a quality album is ‘CHROMOKOPIA” by Tyler, the Creator. It checks all the boxes and does it well. It even adds in introspection which can always add to the quality of an album but not make or break it.

Subject Matter

This is the only trait of a classic album that isnt necessary but can enhance an album tenfold. Subject matter can be done tastefully but on the inverse can really deteriorate an album and remove it from contention of being a classic album.

Introspection on the album will always be a plus but when it is done in a way thats open but vague it leaves a lot to be desired. I don’t want he artist to tell all their busines or even say name but at least be creative with your introspection.

Topics like politics or loss/regret are always a good indicator of a classic album. I also think that when you know what an artist has been through and helps bring context to the album, that can bring the album to classic status.

Albums like ‘There’s a Riot Goin’ On” by Sly and the Family Stone, ‘Innervisons’ by Stevie Wonder, and Controversy by Prince are all projects where the subject matter pushed these artists even further into superstar status. These albums are now considered classics within each respective fan circle.

The ‘classic’ album title is thrown around a lot these days but many people never really understand what makes an album a classic.</p>`, // full HTML content

      content: `<p>“Let me explain this only child style”. This is a bar that, throughout the whole album, kept me hooked and gave me insight as to what the two ATL legends have in store for me as the listener.

This isn’t the only bar that carried weight, but I can’t name them all. “ATLiens” is the second full-length project from Outkast. This is the first project from Outkast that I have listened to all the way through.I feel like this is kind of an insult to the group since I have been in the Metro Atlanta area for the majority of my life, and these have been artists I have heard for so long.

Smooth, slippery, and introspective are the words to describe this whole album. From start to finish, there isn’t a time during the album where I did do the stank face after they said something.

“Jazzy Belle”, “Ovr da Wudz,” “Babylon”, and “Elevators(Me & You) are songs that perfectly encompass the three words smooth, slippery, and introspective.

For example, ‘Elevators(Me & You)’ brings listeners back in time to when Big Boi and 3 Stacks dropped their debut album, “Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik”. Then you get a religious interpretation of the world and Andre’s lustful thoughts in ‘Babylon. ’

Even though this album has songs with “heavy” thought-provoking subject matter, the slippery flow of both members makes the tracks captivating.

When it comes to the flow of Outkast, it's unmatched. This is where the word smooth comes in. Big Boi has one of the best flows in rap history, and it’s heard throughout the rap game now with rappers like JID or Akeem Ali.

When it comes to the length of this album, Andre and Big Boi give listeners 15 songs,

For me, this is the sweet spot when it comes to making an album. 14 to 16 songs are a great way to showcase the concept you want and not give listeners a bunch of fluff/throwaway songs but it is possible to do so.

If they had given us three or four more songs, this album would have felt redundant or too much packed into an album.

These 15 songs are packed with great Organized Noize production. Listening, I hear hints of Tribe [called Quest] or hints of Dilla [J Dilla] but with its twist.

Rico Wade and company provide Outkast with production that I believe can be translated to any other jazz rap/boom bap artist, which is what makes this production great.

I would love to have heard a Tribe Called Quest album with Organized Noize production or even a Kendrick [Lamar] album. That would go crazy.

When it comes to features, I will admit that I have to get used to them. On the first couple of listens, I was not a fan. I felt that they didn't need to be there.

Besides that, there wasn’t anything that was left desired. I got everything I wanted from an OutKast album.

If you start off listening to Outkast, don't start with this album; make sure you listen from “Southernplaylistcadillacmuzik” to “Idlewild”. You will be able to hear the transformation of the duo.

I give this album 5 spins.

        content: `<p>1969 was the year that continued to show the industry how fast Stevie Wonder was transforming into a star. With “My Cherie Amour,” releasing this album would send him closer to superstar status.

He would then add two more smash hits with ‘Signed, Sealed, Delivered(I'm Yours) in 1970, then ‘If You Really Love Me' in 1971, but between 1971 and 1972, a shift would happen.

Motown and Stevie would be in talks about a new contract. The contract would contain conditions that Berry Gordy would have trouble coming to terms with, but would soon bite the bullet, granting Wonder full creative control over his musical career and a $13 million lump sum.

After the contract was finalized, Stevie got to work, and 1972 marked the start of his “Classical Period”. This period would breed some of music's most influential albums.

This period includes: “Music of My Mind”, “Talking Book”, “Innervisions”, ‘Fulfillingness First Finale”, and “ Songs in the Key of Life.”

These amazing albums have influenced listeners and artists alike, and many have them in their top 10, but where do these projects rank amongst each other?

<h1>
1).

Songs in the Key of Life</h1>
<img src="/steviewonder.jpg" alt="Stevie Wonder" width={800} height={500} className="rounded-xl mb-4" />
<p>Many consider this album his magnum opus, and I fully agree. Songs in the Key of Life is one of the most complete albums I have ever heard. There is so much emotion in every song that if you can relate or you can't, the pure emotion that Stevie brings is enough. Even though this album is a double LP, it doesn't feel long. It has 21 songs, each of which takes you into the world of Stevie. Three things make this album great. One, the production. Stevie gathered the best musicians from Herbie Hancock and George Benson to Minnie Ripperton and Bobbi Humphrey. These huge figureheads would contribute to an album that didn't necessarily need them, but with them added to the album, they excelled. Second, the writing. I can name a line from every song. Writing always has been Stevie's strong suit, but on this album, it seemed like all he did was strike gold on every line. It’s a couple of lines in particular that hit home for me. For example, on the 12th track of the second LP, titled “Joy Inside My Tears,” on the second verse, he says, “I’ve always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid to go past yesterday and start living for today.” Simple line, but it's a powerful line that can apply to anyone. Another example is near the end of the second disc on the 9th track titled “Ebony Eyes”. He says, “If there are seven wonders of the world, then I know she’s got to be number one.” Imagine saying that to your partner. That’s such a meaningful line that it would make anyone melt. Finally, what makes this album so great is the emotion and message that every song has within it. From track one to track 21, he doesn’t miss a beat. When you hear a song like “Ordinary Pain”, “Ngiculela-Es Una Historia- I am Singing”, or “Saturn”, where he's just spilling his whole heart into the mic, and behind that emotion comes a refreshing view of life. Songs in the Key of Life is an album that has stood the test of time, and there will never be another album like this.

2).

Music of My Mind</h1>
<img src="/steviewonder2.jpg" alt="Stevie Wonder2" width={800} height={500} className="rounded-xl mb-4" />
<p>This was a hard choice to put at number two, but this album has so much value for me. That’s not to say that the other albums don’t have value, but this album in particular does everything I love extremely well. I can listen to this album from ‘Love Having You Around’ to ‘Evil’. For this to be the start of his classical period is astonishing. This was his most personal album with songs like ‘Superwoman(Where Were You When I Needed You), ‘Keep Running’, ‘Seems So Long’,’ Love Having You Around’, and ‘I Love Every Little Thing About You’. These are all songs that I feel are personal to him and show what he was going through at the time. This album is more of a diary of a 22-year-old Stevie who got his heart broken and is see-sawing between expressing his love and expressing his heartbreak. The pure emotion that he has can be felt through the instrumentals. What he does on this album is a great segue into the albums that come after it.

3).

Fulfillingness First Finale</h1>
<img src="/steviewonder3.jpg" alt="Stevie Wonder3" width={1000} height={800} className="rounded-xl mb-4" />
<p>I previously had this at number two, and it was a tough choice to put at three. This album was masterfully put together. With only 10 songs, this album was a great precursor to Songs in the Key of Life. It’s almost like a smaller version of Songs in the Key of Life. Both albums have political and religious songs. Then they both have slow-ballad-like songs, positive songs, and love songs. Unique in its own right, ‘Fulfillingness First Finale’ is an album that gives listeners an interesting group of songs. I think the most interesting song is “It Aint No Use”. With a song like this on an album, it deviates from the normal Stevie messaging. The title alone can tell you that this is a pessimistic song, and I'm not too sure that he has a song like this in his catalog, but I’m glad we, as listeners, have a song like this. I could listen to the first 11 seconds of this song on repeat simply because of the opening humming. Speaking of background vocals on the track before this, titled “You Haven't Done Nothin',” the Jackson 5 make a cameo that adds to an already funky song and elevates it tenfold. All in all, to be three albums deep into a period that was impactful as it was to music, and for this to be the follow-up to an album that was politically impactful is a feat that artists strive for.

</p><h1>
4).

Innervisions</h1>
<img src="/steviewonder4.jpg" alt="Stevie Wonder4" width={800} height={500} className="rounded-xl mb-4" />
<p>I feel bad for putting this at four because the cultural impact this album had was massive. ‘Living for the City’ is one of my all-time favorite Stevie songs, and to add ‘Higher Ground’ and ‘Jesus Children of America’ in the mix makes this album a masterpiece. ‘Innervisions’ is at four simply because of the impact it had on me, but if I were to make my top 10 Stevie songs, ‘Jesus Children of America’ and“Living For the City would be in the top 5 of my top 10, but unfortunately, this is an album ranking. Cultural relevance is the main driver for why this is at four. I originally put it at five, but I had to be honest about how often I visit this album specifically, ‘Jesus Children of America’. I have never heard a song that criticizes the church in an indirect but direct way. Two albums in, Innervisions didn't stray away from who Stevie was becoming; instead, it amplified his voice even more and put him in a space that cemented him as a genius.
</p>
<h1>
4).
    Talking Book</h1>
<img src="/steviewonder5.jpg" alt="Stevie Wonder5" width={800} height={500} className="rounded-xl mb-4" />
<p>The follow-up to “Music of My Mind”, “Talking Book” is an amazing album, but I believe the four ahead of it hit harder for me. There are songs that I like, but I’m not listening to certain songs on a continuous loop like the songs from the albums above. For example, ‘Big Brother” is a great song, but I only listen to it on a full album run through and not intentionally listen to. Besides that caveat, there isn’t much to say why this album is at five simply because of the impact those four albums have on me.</p>`,
